# Contributing

Simply fork the [`main` branch](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockPlusPlus/tree/main) and commit whatever changes you want to make.

Ensure your fork is up-to-date with the `main` branch, then make a pull request. Keep your changes localized to what needs to be changed to reduce the chance of merge conflicts!

## AI policy

Generally, we're perfectly fine with adding code that was created with the help of AI tooling to our codebase.

What we _don't_ want are slop-commits that just rewrite stuff for the sake of rewriting it. We don't want or need a 505k line mega-commit that adds 26 new files, that all have duplicated functionality, or break other parts of the code.

Keep it reasonable, don't overdo it. This is supposed to be a learning-exercise and fun project for whoever wants to get involved, and to foster a better understanding of how Beta Minecraft works. This project doesn't need to be finished overnight in a half-broken state that nobody understands.

At the very least keep out the 500 line long comments that explain stuff for the sake of explaining it. The code shouls peak for itself!

## Development

Grab the `main` branch for the most up-to-date, albeit unstable, repository.

## Recommended VSCode Extensions

- `clangd` (ideally `clangd-22` or later for Doxygen comment integration)
- CMake Tools
- Doxygen Documentation Generator

## Code Style Guide

The following covers the most important parts on how we style our code. These aren't super hard rules to follow, and most are automatically enforced by the formatter anyways.

### File structure

- File and directory names are in `snake_case`
- We use `LF`-only line endings
- Code files are `.cpp`, Headers are `.h`. While unconventional, its done so headers stick out better among the `.cpp` files. They are **NOT** C-header files!
- **Include the copyright notice at the top!** This also serves as a nice way for people to get credited, if the git history is ever lost. ***Any change*** will get you added to there (within reason). If one already exists, be sure to add your own name *after* those who came before you.

Use the template below if you're creating a new page.

```cpp
/*
 * Copyright (c) [year], [name] <temp@example.com>
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
 *
 */
```

- Unless this is already obvious via its name or usage, **provide a short description what a file is for** the relevant file, why it exists and what its used for
- **Avoid keeping unused includes**. If an included thing is used inside of a `.cpp` file instead of the `.h` file it's included in, please move it out of the `.h` file and into the `.cpp` file!
- Run `run-clang-tidy` and `clang-format` over the files you changed

```bash
run-clang-tidy -fix
clang-format -i $(find ./src -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.h")
```

### General
- Avoid old-style casts, e.g. `(int)5.0f` -> `int(5.0f)`. Using `static_cast<int>(5.0f)` is fine too

### Variables
- Varialbes are written in `cascalCase`
- `#define` blocks and `constexpr` are written in all uppercase snake case, aka `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Avoid **ambiguous abbrevations**. Something like `pos` obviously means position, but just `p` or `m` could be anything. In for-loops or similar these are fine as iterators though
- **Immutable variables** should be marked as `const`
- **Magic numbers** should be turned into `#define` blocks or `constexpr` variables if they only belong to a specific class, struct or function
- Use types that guarantee a **known bit-width** (i.e. `int32_t`, `int16_t` or `int8_t`), unless you need the variable to be architecture dependent, or it's required by an external library that doesn't follow our rules to work
- Enums __must__ have a type
- It's often smart to make enums into **enum classes**, as to avoid arbitrary associations with specific numbers or values
- **Parameters** are prefixed with an underscore, e.g. `_pos`, `_entity`

### Functions
- Functions are written in `PascalCase`
- Make use of **existing functionality**. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use what exists!
- While we are using C++, **avoid using classes** unless necessary or if it results in much cleaner code. Thanks to C++, structs can provide a lot of similar capabilities.
- If possible, **do not pass values separately**. Make use of structs that combine them. For example, instead of `int32_t posX, int32_t posY, int32_t posZ`, just use `Int3 pos`
- Only **pass by reference if it makes sense**. A `bool` can be passed by value. If a set of values are always together, turn them into a struct, then pass that struct of values.
- **Order variables** in structs from largest to smallest, as to reduce padding
- Combine bools via **bitfields**
```cpp
// (2 Bytes)
bool value1;
bool value2;
// (1 Byte / 2 Bits)
bool value1 : 1;
bool value2 : 1;
```
